== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do i place the widget where i want it to be? =

Go in the admin panel under Appearance -> Widgets and place the widget in your desired sidebar, in a specific place.
(drag and drop if on wp 2.8) or drag and save if < wp 2.8
=How to add timer to page/post: =

To add to post or page content, edit post/page or create a new post/page and you will see a box/widget at the right(usually) under categories(if working with post) .<br/>
If you check the checkbox you will be able to configure your plugin and you have to place the embed code [LCT-|-embed] inside your post.
<br/>The embed code will be replaced with the configured timer.
